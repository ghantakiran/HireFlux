### Phase 6: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Ensure all features work together end-to-end

#### 6.1 Integration Testing
- [ ] Run all E2E tests together
- [ ] Test with real backend API
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test credit system integration
- [ ] Test file upload/download

#### 6.2 Unit Test Coverage

- [ ] Test accessibility features

#### 6.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Lighthouse audit (Score ≥90)
- [ ] Bundle size analysis
- [ ] Loading performance (TTFB < 300ms)

### Phase 7: Deployment
**Goal**: Deploy to Vercel with CI/CD

#### 7.1 Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Set up Vercel project
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test build process locally
- [ ] Verify GitHub secrets

#### 7.2 Deployment
- [ ] Push to main branch
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions workflows
- [ ] Verify deployment URL
- [ ] Run smoke tests on production

#### 7.3 Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor error rates in Sentry
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify all integrations work
- [ ] Test on multiple devices/browsers

## Technical Decisions

### UI Framework
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible components
- **Class Variance Authority** for component variants

### Form Management
- **React Hook Form** for performance
- **Zod** for schema validation
- Server and client-side validation

### State Management
- **Zustand** for global state (lightweight)
- React Context for theme/auth
- URL state for filters/pagination

### Testing Strategy
- **Jest** for unit tests
- **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Playwright** for E2E tests
- **MSW** for API mocking in tests

### API Integration
- **Axios** with interceptors
- Automatic token refresh
- Global error handling
- Request/response logging

### Code Quality
- **ESLint** with strict rules
- **Prettier** for formatting
- **TypeScript** strict mode
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code
4. **Repeat**: Move to next feature

### Feature Development
1. Create unit tests for component
2. Implement component to pass tests
3. Create integration tests if needed
4. Run relevant E2E tests
5. Fix any failing E2E tests
6. Code review and refactor
7. Commit with descriptive message

### PR Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Run all tests locally
4. Push branch and create PR
5. GitHub Actions runs CI
6. Code review
7. Merge to main
8. Automatic deployment to Vercel

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- [ ] ≥80% test coverage
- [ ] Zero ESLint errors
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] All E2E tests passing

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse score ≥90
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB (initial)

### User Experience
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] < 3 second page loads
- [ ] Smooth animations (60fps)

### Reliability
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] < 1% error rate
- [ ] Successful deployment rate > 95%
- [ ] E2E test pass rate > 98%

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Set up CI/CD infrastructure
2. ✅ Create comprehensive E2E tests
3. ✅ Set up Vercel configuration
4. → **Start Phase 1: Create shared components with TDD**
5. → **Start Phase 2: Implement authentication**

## Notes

- Follow TDD strictly: Write test first, then implementation
- Use E2E tests as acceptance criteria
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Update this plan as requirements evolve
- Document any deviations from the plan
