## Deferred to Post-MVP

**Not in scope for Sprints 6-10**:

1. **Interview Buddy** (Phase 2)
   - Mock interviews with AI
   - STAR framework feedback
   - **Reason**: Nice-to-have, not core to application flow

2. **Auto-Apply Configuration UI** (Phase 2)
   - UI for auto-apply rules
   - **Reason**: Backend works via API

3. **Notifications Center** (Phase 2)
   - In-app notifications
   - **Reason**: Email notifications work

4. **Advanced Analytics** (Phase 2)
   - Detailed charts and graphs
   - **Reason**: Basic analytics sufficient for MVP

5. **Admin Dashboard** (Phase 2)
   - User management
   - **Reason**: Can manage via database initially
